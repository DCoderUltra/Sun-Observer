# Sun Observer
V 1.0

Allows to download and analyze the sun behaviour for the last 24 hours.
This compilation of bash scripts go to the NASA website and downloads the images captured by their sattelites and allows the user to see a beutigul gif that captures the sun movement thourght the last 2 days.

Legal Notice:
All images are property of Nasa and credits are atributted in each picture by running the script credits.sh.
This project is only for educational propuses and for astronomy enthusiasts to observe and monitor the sun.

Bugs:
This project is still in development so it may contain some bugs in the data download specifically in changing of months and in the first days of the month, as soon as I can I'll fix them.
